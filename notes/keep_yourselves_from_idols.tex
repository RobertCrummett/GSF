	The Father has to be your peace. Not anything or anyone else.
	You slot women too high in your life. This goes back to having
	idols in your heart. Being a man means not compromising what
	you stand for for anyone, under any circumstance. Leaders cannot
	compromise.

	\begin{quote}
		\BibleJohnSixteenThirtyThree{}
	\end{quote}

	Overcome: To prevail, To conquer. Who's name does this name
	remind you of? Jacob's name Israel is one.

	Overcoming the world is having power with God.

	\begin{quote}

	What does wrestling mean? A struggle. To overcome, you have
	to have a struggle.

	\begin{quote}
		\BibleMatthewTwentySixFortyOne{}
	\end{quote}

	What does it mean to overcome the world? How do you do
	it? By faith. Not through the law. What do you receive for
	overcoming the world? It doesn't matter if you keep the 
	law or not, because people without faith keep the law and 
	\textbf{sin}.

	What do you see in Genesis One? God created man by a word. 
	In Genesis Two you see what he made the man from, and how
	he does it.

	What does equal mean? Equality means equality in status, 
	quantity, degree, value.

	The heavens and Earth were complete.

	You must be laser focused. Be laser focused on what other people
	say. When you really listen to them, you can catch when they make
	a slip or make a fallacy. \textbf{Listen} to other people, and you
	will ascertain very quickly whether or not people took the time
	to read and study diligently.

	Same generations. These are the generations of heaven and Earth.
	Why would God start doing the same work that he already rested
	from?

	\begin{quote}
		\BibleGenesisOneTwentySeven{}
	\end{quote}

	God knew he was going to pull the woman out of the man.
